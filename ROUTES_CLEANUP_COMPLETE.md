# Routes Cleanup - Port 3000 Dashboard Service

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## What Was Deleted

Removed **outdated/duplicate routes** from the dashboard service (port 3000):

### 1. ❌ Root Dashboard (`app/page.tsx`) - DELETED
**Size**: 14 KB
**Reason**: Customer dashboard now lives on port 3003 (main frontend)
- Old hero metrics view
- AI Visibility Heatmap
- 3D Competitor Landscape
- Smart Recommendations
- Activity Feed
- Demo mode

### 2. ❌ Demo Route (`app/demo/`) - DELETED
**Size**: 8 KB
**Reason**: Demo functionality moved to main frontend (port 3003)

### 3. ❌ Login Route (`app/login/`) - DELETED
**Size**: 1 KB
**Reason**: Authentication handled by main frontend (port 3003)

### 4. ❌ Dashboard Dynamic Route (`app/dashboard/[id]/`) - DELETED
**Size**: Minimal
**Reason**: Individual dashboard views now on port 3003 at `/dashboard/{audit_id}`

---

## What Remains (Active & Needed)

### ✅ Admin Panel (`app/admin/`) - KEPT
**Purpose**: Internal operations/monitoring dashboard
**Active**: YES (making API calls every 60 seconds)
**Features**:
- Company journey analytics
- User behavior tracking
- Onboarding conversion metrics
- Edit tracking
- Data quality monitoring
- System health checks

### ✅ Root Redirect (`app/page.tsx`) - RECREATED
**Purpose**: Redirects root (`/`) to `/admin`
**Size**: Minimal (simple redirect component)
**Reason**: Next.js requires a root page; now redirects to admin

---

## Current Service Structure

### Port 3000 (Dashboard Service) - Admin Only
```
http://localhost:3000/        → Redirects to /admin
http://localhost:3000/admin   → Internal admin control panel ✅
```

### Port 3003 (Main Frontend) - Customer Facing
```
http://localhost:3003/                      → Landing/onboarding
http://localhost:3003/onboarding/*          → Onboarding flow
http://localhost:3003/dashboard/{audit_id}  → Customer dashboard
```

├── globals.css      ✅ (keep)
├── providers.tsx    ✅ (keep)
└── favicon.ico      ✅ (keep)
```

### After Cleanup
```
services/dashboard/app/

## Impact

### ✅ Benefits
1. **Cleaner codebase** - No duplicate/outdated routes
2. **Clear separation** - Port 3000 = Admin, Port 3003 = Customer
3. **No confusion** - Single source of truth for customer dashboard (port 3003)
4. **Maintained functionality** - Admin panel still works perfectly

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- `http://localhost:3000/` now redirects to `/admin` (was customer dashboard)
- `http://localhost:3000/demo` removed (use port 3003 if needed)
- `http://localhost:3000/login` removed (use port 3003 login)
- `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/{id}` removed (use port 3003)

### ✅ No Impact On
- Admin panel (`/admin`) - **still works perfectly**
- Main frontend (port 3003) - **unchanged**
- API Gateway (port 4000) - **unchanged**
- Intelligence Engine (port 8002) - **unchanged**

---

## Testing

### Verify Admin Panel Still Works
```bash
# Check admin panel loads
curl -I http://localhost:3000/admin

# Check root redirects to admin
curl -I http://localhost:3000/

# Check API calls still work
curl http://localhost:4000/api/admin/control/system/health
```

### Verify Customer Dashboard (Port 3003)
```bash
# Check main frontend
curl -I http://localhost:3003/

# Check customer dashboard
curl -I http://localhost:3003/dashboard/some-audit-id
```

## Service Responsibilities (Clear Definition)

### Port 3000 - Admin Dashboard Service
**Audience**: Internal team (ops, engineering, product)
**Purpose**: System monitoring, debugging, operations
**Routes**:
- `/admin` - Company journey tracking, system health, metrics

### Port 3003 - Main Frontend
**Audience**: Customers (end users)
**Purpose**: User-facing application
**Routes**:
- `/` - Landing page
- `/onboarding/*` - User onboarding flow
- `/dashboard/{audit_id}` - Customer dashboard with audit results

---

## Next Steps

None required - cleanup is complete and services are properly separated.

**Optional**: Consider renaming the "dashboard" service to "admin-dashboard" or "ops-dashboard" for clarity since it only serves admin routes now.

---

## Summary

✅ **Deleted 4 outdated routes** (~23 KB)
✅ **Created redirect page** for root → admin
✅ **Admin panel** remains fully functional
✅ **Clear separation** between admin (3000) and customer (3003) services
✅ **No breaking changes** to active functionality

**The port 3000 service is now a dedicated admin/operations dashboard.**
