-- =====================================================
-- GEO/SOV Query Performance Optimization
-- Adds indexes and materialized views for dashboard queries
-- =====================================================

-- 1. Add missing indexes for GEO/SOV score columns
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_responses_geo_score ON ai_responses(geo_score) WHERE geo_score IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_responses_sov_score ON ai_responses(sov_score) WHERE sov_score IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_visibility_reports_geo_score ON ai_visibility_reports(geo_score) WHERE geo_score IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_visibility_reports_sov_score ON ai_visibility_reports(sov_score) WHERE sov_score IS NOT NULL;

-- 2. Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_responses_company_provider ON ai_responses(company_id, provider);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_responses_created_at_desc ON ai_responses(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_visibility_reports_company_created ON ai_visibility_reports(company_id, created_at DESC);

-- 3. Index for audit_score_breakdown table (if exists)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_audit_score_breakdown_audit_id ON audit_score_breakdown(audit_id) WHERE audit_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_audit_score_breakdown_geo ON audit_score_breakdown(geo DESC) WHERE geo IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_audit_score_breakdown_sov ON audit_score_breakdown(sov DESC) WHERE sov IS NOT NULL;

-- 4. Create materialized view for dashboard metrics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS dashboard_metrics_cache AS
SELECT 
  c.id as company_id,
  c.name as company_name,
  c.domain,
  -- Latest scores
  (SELECT geo_score FROM ai_visibility_reports WHERE company_id = c.id ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1) as latest_geo_score,
  (SELECT sov_score FROM ai_visibility_reports WHERE company_id = c.id ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1) as latest_sov_score,
  (SELECT overall_score FROM ai_visibility_reports WHERE company_id = c.id ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1) as latest_overall_score,
  -- Score averages by provider
  (SELECT json_object_agg(provider, avg_score) 
   FROM (
     SELECT provider, AVG(COALESCE(geo_score, 0) * 0.3 + COALESCE(sov_score, 0) * 0.25) as avg_score
     FROM ai_responses 
     WHERE company_id = c.id AND provider IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY provider
   ) provider_scores
  ) as provider_scores,
  -- Total counts
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_queries WHERE company_id = c.id) as total_queries,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_responses WHERE company_id = c.id) as total_responses,
  -- Historical data for sparklines (last 7 days)
  (SELECT json_agg(day_data ORDER BY date)
   FROM (
     SELECT 
       DATE(created_at) as date,
       AVG(overall_score) as score
     FROM ai_visibility_reports
     WHERE company_id = c.id 
       AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
     GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
   ) day_data
  ) as sparkline_data,
  -- Last updated
  NOW() as cached_at
FROM companies c
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ai_visibility_reports WHERE company_id = c.id);

-- Index on the materialized view
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_dashboard_metrics_cache_company ON dashboard_metrics_cache(company_id);

-- 5. Create materialized view for heatmap data
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS heatmap_cache AS
WITH response_scores AS (
  SELECT 
    ar.company_id,
    ar.provider,
    aq.category,
    COALESCE(ar.geo_score, 0) * 0.3 + COALESCE(ar.sov_score, 0) * 0.25 as weighted_score,
    ar.created_at
  FROM ai_responses ar
  INNER JOIN ai_queries aq ON aq.id::text = ar.query_id
  WHERE ar.provider IS NOT NULL 
    AND aq.category IS NOT NULL
    AND ar.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT 
  company_id,
  provider,
  category,
  AVG(weighted_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) as data_points,
  MAX(created_at) as last_updated
FROM response_scores
GROUP BY company_id, provider, category;

-- Indexes on heatmap cache
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_heatmap_cache_company ON heatmap_cache(company_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_heatmap_cache_provider ON heatmap_cache(provider);

-- 6. Create activity events cache for recent GEO/SOV changes
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS activity_events_cache AS
WITH score_changes AS (
  SELECT 
    company_id,
    created_at,
    geo_score,
    sov_score,
    overall_score,
    LAG(geo_score) OVER (PARTITION BY company_id ORDER BY created_at) as prev_geo,
    LAG(sov_score) OVER (PARTITION BY company_id ORDER BY created_at) as prev_sov,
    LAG(overall_score) OVER (PARTITION BY company_id ORDER BY created_at) as prev_overall
  FROM ai_visibility_reports
  WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
SELECT 
  company_id,
  created_at as timestamp,
  CASE 
    WHEN geo_score > COALESCE(prev_geo, 0) THEN 'success'
    WHEN geo_score < COALESCE(prev_geo, 100) THEN 'warning'
    ELSE 'info'
  END as type,
  'ai' as category,
  CASE 
    WHEN geo_score != prev_geo THEN 
      CONCAT('GEO Score ', 
        CASE WHEN geo_score > prev_geo THEN 'Improved' ELSE 'Changed' END,
        ' to ', ROUND(geo_score::numeric, 1), '%')
    WHEN sov_score != prev_sov THEN
      CONCAT('SOV ', 
        CASE WHEN sov_score > prev_sov THEN 'Increased' ELSE 'Changed' END,
        ' to ', ROUND(sov_score::numeric, 1), '%')
    ELSE 'Score Updated'
  END as title,
  json_build_object(
    'geo_score', geo_score,
    'sov_score', sov_score,
    'overall_score', overall_score,
    'prev_geo', prev_geo,
    'prev_sov', prev_sov,
    'change_geo', geo_score - COALESCE(prev_geo, geo_score),
    'change_sov', sov_score - COALESCE(prev_sov, sov_score)
  ) as metadata
FROM score_changes
WHERE (geo_score != prev_geo OR sov_score != prev_sov)
  AND (prev_geo IS NOT NULL OR prev_sov IS NOT NULL);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_activity_events_cache_company ON activity_events_cache(company_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_activity_events_cache_timestamp ON activity_events_cache(timestamp DESC);

-- 7. Function to refresh materialized views (call periodically)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_dashboard_caches()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY dashboard_metrics_cache;
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY heatmap_cache;
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY activity_events_cache;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- 8. Create a scheduled job to refresh caches every 5 minutes (requires pg_cron extension)
-- If pg_cron is available, uncomment the following:
-- SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-dashboard-caches', '*/5 * * * *', 'SELECT refresh_dashboard_caches();');

-- 9. Add comment documentation
COMMENT ON MATERIALIZED VIEW dashboard_metrics_cache IS 'Cached metrics for dashboard performance - refreshed every 5 minutes';
COMMENT ON MATERIALIZED VIEW heatmap_cache IS 'Pre-aggregated heatmap data for AI visibility by platform and category';
COMMENT ON MATERIALIZED VIEW activity_events_cache IS 'Recent GEO/SOV score changes for activity feed';
COMMENT ON FUNCTION refresh_dashboard_caches() IS 'Refreshes all dashboard materialized views';
