## 📝 NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

When starting next session in Claude Code:
1. Read this file first for current status
2. Check `.claude/prompts/intelligence-engine.md` for next module specs
3. Foundation and AI Response Monitor are COMPLETE - start Intelligence Engine
4. Use Foundation's EventBus and ServiceRegistry
5. Subscribe to AI response events from AI Response Monitor
6. Update this file after completing work

### Foundation Module Usage:
```typescript
// Import Foundation components
import { EventBus } from '../foundation/src/core/event-bus';
import { ServiceRegistry } from '../foundation/src/core/service-registry';
import { Microservice } from '../foundation/src/core/microservice';

// Extend Microservice base class for new services
class AIResponseMonitor extends Microservice {
  // Implementation
}
```

## 🚨 DO NOT FORGET
- Every implementation must be production-ready
- No mocks or stubs in production code
- All services must have health checks
- Everything must be monitored
- Keep infrastructure costs under $50/month
