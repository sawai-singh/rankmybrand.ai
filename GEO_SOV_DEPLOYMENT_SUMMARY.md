# GEO and SOV Integration - Deployment Summary

## Date: 2025-08-22
## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

---

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully integrated GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) and SOV (Share of Voice) calculators into the AI Visibility audit workflow. These calculators were previously initialized but never used - they are now fully integrated and calculating scores for all ~192 responses per audit.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Code Integration**
- ✅ Enhanced `response_analyzer.py` with GEO/SOV calculation methods
- ✅ Updated `job_processor.py` to use enhanced scoring formula
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with aliases
- ✅ Added GEO/SOV specific insights generation

### 2. **Database Migration**
- ✅ Created comprehensive backup: `rankmybrand_backup_20250822_111553.sql`
- ✅ Added columns to `ai_responses` table:
  - `geo_score` (NUMERIC 5,2)
  - `sov_score` (NUMERIC 5,2)  
  - `context_completeness_score` (NUMERIC 5,2)
- ✅ Added columns to `ai_visibility_reports` table
- ✅ Created `score_breakdown` table for detailed tracking
- ✅ Created `provider_score_metrics` table
- ✅ Added PostgreSQL functions and triggers
- ✅ Created performance indexes

### 3. **Enhanced Scoring Formula**
```
Overall Score = GEO × 0.30 + SOV × 0.25 + Recommendation × 0.20 + Sentiment × 0.15 + Visibility × 0.10
```

---

## 📊 Test Results

### Database Function Test
```sql
SELECT calculate_enhanced_overall_score(75, 85, 80, 70, 90);
-- Result: 79.25 ✓ (Correct weighted calculation)
```

### Schema Verification
- ✅ All new columns added successfully
- ✅ New tables created with proper constraints
- ✅ Indexes created for performance
- ✅ Triggers installed and ready

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### 1. **Service Deployment**
```bash
# Stop current service
pm2 stop intelligence-engine

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies if needed
cd services/intelligence-engine && npm install

# Restart service
pm2 restart intelligence-engine
```

### 2. **Monitor Initial Audits**
- Watch logs for GEO/SOV calculations
- Verify scores are being stored
- Check insights generation

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
- Monitor query performance with new calculations
- Check database trigger execution time
- Watch for any memory issues

---

## 🔍 What to Monitor

### Key Metrics
1. **GEO Scores**: Should range 0-100, higher is better
2. **SOV Scores**: Percentage 0-100%, shows brand dominance
3. **Processing Time**: Should not significantly increase
4. **Database Storage**: New columns add ~12 bytes per response

### Expected Insights
- Low GEO (<40): "Poor Generative Engine Optimization"
- Low SOV (<25): "Critical: Your Share of Voice is only X%"
- Combined patterns: High GEO + Low SOV scenarios

## 🛡️ Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is simple:

```sql
-- Rollback migration
ALTER TABLE ai_responses 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS geo_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS sov_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS context_completeness_score;

ALTER TABLE ai_visibility_reports
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS geo_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS sov_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS context_completeness_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS overall_score;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS score_breakdown;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS provider_score_metrics;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS calculate_enhanced_overall_score;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_report_score_summary;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_report_aggregate_scores;

-- Restore from backup if needed
psql -d rankmybrand < backups/rankmybrand_backup_20250822_111553.sql
```

---

## 📈 Expected Benefits

1. **Better Insights**: Understand AI engine optimization effectiveness
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Clear SOV metrics vs competitors
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific GEO/SOV improvements
4. **Trend Tracking**: Monitor scores over time
5. **Provider Comparison**: See which AI providers favor your brand

---

## 📝 Notes

- Migration script adapted for actual schema (UUID types, not VARCHAR)
- Test suite created at `tests/test_geo_sov_integration.py`
- All backward compatibility maintained
- No breaking changes to existing API

---

## ✨ Summary

The GEO and SOV integration is complete and ready for production deployment. The system will now automatically calculate and store these metrics for every AI response, providing valuable insights into brand performance across AI engines.

**Recommendation**: Deploy during low-traffic period and monitor the first few audits closely to ensure smooth operation.
