# 🔴 CRITICAL BUG: boAt Audit Zero Scores Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Audit ID:** `79bcfe2f-8c4c-463d-a182-9fd204822fc2`
**Company:** Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)
**Company ID:** 191
**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Silent failure with zero scores despite successful analysis

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

The boAt audit completed with status="completed" but produced **zero scores across all metrics** despite having 140 successfully analyzed responses. Investigation revealed **TWO CRITICAL BUGS**:

1. **Brand Detection Failure** - Response analyzer fails to detect brand names in parentheses
2. **Company Name Loss** - Dashboard population shows "Unknown Company" instead of actual name

**Impact:** Audit appears successful to users but provides completely incorrect data (all zeros).

**Root Cause:** Flawed brand name extraction logic in response analyzer + potential exception handling issue in dashboard populator.

---

## 🔍 **Investigation Findings**

### **Finding 1: Audit Completion Status** ✅ BUT ❌

```sql
SELECT id, company_name, status, current_phase, query_count,
       overall_score, brand_mention_rate, error_message,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - started_at))/60 as duration_minutes
FROM ai_visibility_audits
WHERE id = '79bcfe2f-8c4c-463d-a182-9fd204822fc2';
```

**Results:**
- ✅ **Status:** `completed`
- ❌ **overall_score:** `0.00`
- ❌ **brand_mention_rate:** `0.00`
- ❌ **error_message:** `'str' object has no attribute 'get'`
- ⏱️ **Duration:** 5.88 minutes (suspiciously fast)

**Analysis:** The audit marked itself as completed despite encountering a Python error. The error message suggests code tried to call `.get()` on a string instead of a dictionary.

---

### **Finding 2: Pipeline Completion Check** ✅ EXCEPT SCORES

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_queries WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f...') as queries_generated,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_responses WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f...') as responses_collected,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_responses WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f...' AND geo_score IS NOT NULL) as responses_analyzed,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dashboard_data WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f...') as dashboard_populated,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_score_breakdown WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f...') as score_breakdown_exists;
```

**Results:**
| Stage | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Queries Generated | 47 | ✅ Pass |
| Responses Collected | 141 | ✅ Pass |
| Responses Analyzed | 140 | ✅ Pass |
| Dashboard Populated | 1 | ✅ Pass |
| Score Breakdown | **0** | ❌ **FAIL** |

**Analysis:** All pipeline stages completed successfully, but the critical `audit_score_breakdown` table entry is **missing**. This table should store aggregate scores and is likely where scoring logic failed.

---

### **Finding 3: Dashboard Data Corruption** ❌ CRITICAL

```sql
SELECT audit_id, company_id, company_name, overall_score, geo_score, sov_score,
       brand_mention_rate, total_queries, total_responses
FROM dashboard_data
WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f-8c4c-463d-a182-9fd204822fc2';
```

**Results:**
```
audit_id: 79bcfe2f-8c4c-463d-a182-9fd204822fc2
company_id: 191 ✅ (correct)
company_name: "Unknown Company" ❌ (WRONG!)
overall_score: 10.00 ❓ (Why 10? Should be 0)
geo_score: 0.00 ❌
sov_score: 0.00 ❌
brand_mention_rate: 0.00 ❌
total_queries: 47 ✅
total_responses: 141 ✅
```

**Analysis:** Dashboard was populated but with:
1. Wrong company name ("Unknown Company" instead of "Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)")
2. All key scores at zero
3. Mysterious overall_score of 10.00 (inconsistent with zeros)

---

### **Finding 4: Response Analysis Verification** ❌ **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**

```sql
SELECT id, provider, geo_score, sov_score, brand_mentioned,
       substring(query_text, 1, 60) as query_preview,
       substring(response_text, 1, 150) as response_preview
FROM audit_responses
WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f...' AND geo_score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```

**Sample Results:**
```
Query: "buy boAt Rockerz online"
Response: "Here are a few options to buy the boAt Rockerz headphones online:

1. Amazon India: You can purchase the boAt Rockerz series on Amazon India..."

Provider: anthropic_claude
brand_mentioned: FALSE ❌ (WRONG!)
geo_score: 0.00
sov_score: 0.00
mention_count: 0
```

**🚨 SMOKING GUN:** The response text **CLEARLY mentions "boAt"** multiple times:
- "buy the **boAt** Rockerz headphones"
- "**boAt** Rockerz series on Amazon"
- "**boAt** products"

But the analysis marked `brand_mentioned = false` and `mention_count = 0`!

---

## 🐛 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Bug #1: Brand Detection Failure in Response Analyzer**

**Location:** `services/intelligence-engine/src/core/analysis/response_analyzer.py:376`

**Buggy Code:**
```python
def _fast_analysis(self, response_text: str, query: str, brand_name: str, ...):
    response_lower = response_text.lower()
    brand_lower = brand_name.lower()

    # Extract the main brand name (first word) for better detection
    # e.g., "Bikaji Foods International Ltd." -> "bikaji"
    main_brand = brand_lower.split()[0] if brand_lower else brand_lower

    # Brand mention analysis - check both full name and main brand
    brand_mentioned = (brand_lower in response_lower) or (main_brand in response_lower)
```

**Problem:**
When `brand_name = "Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)"`:
1. `brand_lower = "imagine marketing limited (boat)"`
2. `main_brand = "imagine"` (first word only)
3. Searches for "imagine marketing limited (boat)" OR "imagine"
4. Response text says "**boAt**" (not "Imagine")
5. ❌ **No match found** → `brand_mentioned = False`

**Why This Happens:**
The code extracts the first word to handle corporate names like "Bikaji Foods International Ltd." But it **fails for companies where the popular brand name is in parentheses**. The parenthetical brand name is what people actually use!

**Affected Companies:**
- ✅ Works: "Nike", "Apple", "Microsoft" (simple names)
- ✅ Works: "Bikaji Foods" (first word is brand)
- ❌ **FAILS:** "Imagine Marketing Limited (**boAt**)" (brand in parentheses)
- ❌ **FAILS:** "Meta Platforms (**Facebook**)" (if they used old name)

---

### **Bug #2: Company Name Loss in Dashboard Populator**

**Location:** `services/intelligence-engine/src/core/services/dashboard_data_populator.py:350-429`

**Suspected Issue:**
```python
async def _gather_company_data(self, company_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT name as company_name, domain, industry, ...
            FROM companies
            WHERE id = %s
        """, (company_id,))

        company_data = cursor.fetchone()

        if not company_data:
            logger.warning(f"No company data found for company_id {company_id}")
            return {
                'company_name': 'Unknown Company',  # ← FALLBACK TRIGGERED
                'domain': '',
                ...
            }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error gathering company data: {e}")
        return {
            'company_name': 'Unknown Company',  # ← OR EXCEPTION CAUGHT
            ...
        }
```

**Why "Unknown Company" Appeared:**
- Company ID 191 **EXISTS** in database (verified: `SELECT * FROM companies WHERE id = 191` returns boAt)
- But dashboard_data shows "Unknown Company"
- This means **EITHER:**
  1. `cursor.fetchone()` returned None (database connection issue?)
  2. Exception was thrown and caught (likely related to "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error)

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- This query WORKS and returns correct data
SELECT name FROM companies WHERE id = 191;
-- Result: "Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)"
```

So the SQL is correct, but the Python function returned defaults instead.

## 💥 **Impact Assessment**

### **Severity: CRITICAL 🔴**

**User Experience:**
- ❌ Audit shows "Completed ✅" (misleading)
- ❌ All scores show as 0.00 (incorrect)
- ❌ Company name shows as "Unknown Company" (unprofessional)
- ❌ Brand mentioned in 0% of responses (FALSE - actually mentioned frequently)
- ❌ No actionable insights (all zeros mean no recommendations)

**Business Impact:**
- **Loss of Trust:** Customer pays for audit, receives zeros
- **Support Burden:** Users will report "audit not working"
- **Revenue Risk:** Users may request refunds
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Competitors' tools will show accurate data

**Technical Debt:**
- Silent failure (no loud error, just zeros)
- Affects companies with parenthetical brand names
- Dashboard corruption persists in database

## 🔧 **Proposed Fixes**

### **Fix #1: Smart Brand Name Extraction**

**File:** `services/intelligence-engine/src/core/analysis/response_analyzer.py`
**Function:** `_fast_analysis` (lines 361-464)

**Current Code (lines 374-376):**
```python
# Extract the main brand name (first word) for better detection
# e.g., "Bikaji Foods International Ltd." -> "bikaji"
main_brand = brand_lower.split()[0] if brand_lower else brand_lower
```

**Proposed Fix:**
```python
def _extract_brand_variations(brand_name: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Extract all possible brand name variations for matching.

    Handles cases like:
    - "Nike" → ["nike"]
    - "Bikaji Foods International Ltd." → ["bikaji", "bikaji foods"]
    - "Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)" → ["boat", "imagine marketing", "imagine"]
    """
    brand_lower = brand_name.lower()
    variations = [brand_lower]  # Full name

    # Extract parenthetical brand name (highest priority)
    import re
    paren_match = re.search(r'\(([^)]+)\)', brand_name)
    if paren_match:
        paren_brand = paren_match.group(1).strip().lower()
        variations.insert(0, paren_brand)  # Highest priority

    # Extract first word (fallback for traditional names)
    first_word = brand_lower.split()[0] if brand_lower else brand_lower
    if first_word not in variations:
        variations.append(first_word)

    # Extract first two words (for "Bikaji Foods" etc.)
    words = brand_lower.split()
    if len(words) >= 2:
        first_two = f"{words[0]} {words[1]}"
        if first_two not in variations:
            variations.append(first_two)

    return variations

# Then in _fast_analysis:
brand_variations = self._extract_brand_variations(brand_name)

# Brand mention analysis - check ALL variations
brand_mentioned = any(variation in response_lower for variation in brand_variations)

# Count mentions across ALL variations
mention_count = sum(response_lower.count(variation) for variation in brand_variations)

# Find first position (earliest match across all variations)
first_positions = [
    response_lower.find(var) for var in brand_variations
    if response_lower.find(var) >= 0
]
first_position = min(first_positions) if first_positions else None
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ For "boAt": Extracts `["boat", "imagine marketing", "imagine"]` → Finds "boat" immediately
- ✅ For "Bikaji Foods": Extracts `["bikaji", "bikaji foods"]` → Works as before
- ✅ For "Nike": Extracts `["nike"]` → Simple case still works
- ✅ Prioritizes parenthetical names (most specific)

### **Fix #2: Robust Company Data Retrieval**

**File:** `services/intelligence-engine/src/core/services/dashboard_data_populator.py`
**Function:** `_gather_company_data` (lines 350-429)

**Issue:** Silent failure when company exists but data not retrieved

**Proposed Fix:**
```python
async def _gather_company_data(self, company_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Gather company and enrichment data with robust error handling"""
    conn = self._get_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=RealDictCursor)

    try:
        logger.info(f"[COMPANY-DATA] Retrieving company_id={company_id}")

        # ... existing logo check logic ...

        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT
                name as company_name,
                domain,
                industry,
                employee_count,
                COALESCE(headquarters_city || ', ' || headquarters_country, 'Boston, USA') as headquarters,
                logo_url
            FROM companies
            WHERE id = %s
        """, (company_id,))

        company_data = cursor.fetchone()

        if not company_data:
            error_msg = f"❌ No company data found for company_id {company_id}"
            logger.error(error_msg)

            # CRITICAL: Raise exception instead of silent fallback
            raise ValueError(f"Company {company_id} not found in database")

        # Convert to dict
        result = dict(company_data)

        # Validate company_name is not empty
        if not result.get('company_name') or result['company_name'].strip() == '':
            raise ValueError(f"Company {company_id} has empty name")

        logger.info(f"✅ Retrieved company: {result['company_name']}")

        # ... existing logo sanitization logic ...

        return result

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"❌ CRITICAL: Error gathering company data for {company_id}: {e}")
        logger.error(f"Stack trace: {traceback.format_exc()}")

        # DO NOT return silent defaults - re-raise to expose the bug
        raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to retrieve company {company_id}") from e

    finally:
        cursor.close()
        self._return_connection(conn)
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Raises exception instead of silent fallback
- ✅ Forces investigation of root cause
- ✅ Prevents "Unknown Company" from appearing
- ✅ Better logging for debugging

---

### **Fix #3: Validate Brand Detection Before Scoring**

**File:** `services/intelligence-engine/src/core/services/job_processor.py`
**Location:** Before GEO/SOV calculation

**Add Validation:**
```python
async def _analyze_responses(self, audit_id: str, context: QueryContext):
    """Analyze responses with brand detection validation"""

    # ... existing analysis code ...

    # VALIDATION: Check if brand was detected at all
    total_responses = len(responses_to_analyze)
    brand_detected_count = sum(
        1 for r in responses_to_analyze
        if r.get('brand_mentioned', False)
    )

    brand_detection_rate = (brand_detected_count / total_responses * 100) if total_responses > 0 else 0

    if brand_detection_rate < 5:  # Less than 5% detection = likely bug
        logger.warning("")
        logger.warning("=" * 80)
        logger.warning(f"⚠️ BRAND DETECTION WARNING FOR AUDIT {audit_id}")
        logger.warning("=" * 80)
        logger.warning(f"Company: {context.company_name}")
        logger.warning(f"Brand detected in only {brand_detection_rate:.1f}% of responses ({brand_detected_count}/{total_responses})")
        logger.warning(f"This may indicate a brand name matching issue.")
        logger.warning(f"")
        logger.warning(f"Sample response text:")
        if responses_to_analyze:
            logger.warning(f"{responses_to_analyze[0].get('response_text', '')[:200]}...")
        logger.warning("=" * 80)
        logger.warning("")

    return analysis_results
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Catches low detection rates before scoring
- ✅ Provides diagnostic information
- ✅ Helps identify similar issues in future
- ✅ Could trigger automatic fallback to alternative detection method

---

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

### **Test Case 1: Verify Fix for boAt**

```python
# Test brand variation extraction
brand_variations = _extract_brand_variations("Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)")
assert "boat" in brand_variations
assert brand_variations[0] == "boat"  # Highest priority

# Test detection in sample response
response = "Here are options to buy the boAt Rockerz headphones online..."
assert any(var in response.lower() for var in brand_variations)
```

### **Test Case 2: Regression Test for Existing Brands**

```python
test_cases = [
    ("Nike", ["nike"]),
    ("Bikaji Foods International Ltd.", ["bikaji", "bikaji foods"]),
    ("Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)", ["boat", "imagine marketing limited", "imagine"]),
    ("Meta Platforms (Facebook)", ["facebook", "meta platforms", "meta"]),
]

for brand_name, expected_variations in test_cases:
    variations = _extract_brand_variations(brand_name)
    for expected in expected_variations:
        assert expected in variations, f"Missing {expected} for {brand_name}"
```

### **Test Case 3: End-to-End Audit**

```bash
# Re-run boAt audit after fix
POST /api/analyze/complete
{
  "companyId": 191,
  "queryCount": 10
}

# Verify results
SELECT
  overall_score,
  brand_mention_rate,
  company_name
FROM dashboard_data
WHERE company_id = 191
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

# Expected:
# - overall_score > 0 (not zero!)
# - brand_mention_rate > 50% (boAt is mentioned frequently)
# - company_name = "Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)" (not "Unknown Company")
```

---

## 📊 **Data Cleanup Required**

### **Option 1: Re-run boAt Audit**

```bash
# Use Resume Audit button to salvage existing data
# OR trigger full re-audit after applying fixes
POST http://localhost:4000/api/admin/control/audits/79bcfe2f-8c4c-463d-a182-9fd204822fc2/resume
```

### **Option 2: Manual Database Fix (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

```sql
-- This doesn't fix the underlying analysis, just the dashboard display
UPDATE dashboard_data
SET company_name = 'Imagine Marketing Limited (boAt)'
WHERE audit_id = '79bcfe2f-8c4c-463d-a182-9fd204822fc2';

-- But scores will still be zero because responses weren't re-analyzed
```

**⚠️ Recommendation:** Re-run audit after fixes are applied.

---

2. ✏️ `services/intelligence-engine/src/core/services/dashboard_data_populator.py` (lines 350-429)
3. ✏️ `services/intelligence-engine/src/core/services/job_processor.py` (add validation)

### **Files to Test:**
1. 🧪 Test with audit ID: `79bcfe2f-8c4c-463d-a182-9fd204822fc2`
2. 🧪 Test with company ID: `191`
3. 🧪 Verify sample responses mention "boAt"

### **Database Tables Affected:**
- `ai_visibility_audits` (error_message field)
- `audit_responses` (brand_mentioned, mention_count = 0)
- `dashboard_data` (company_name = "Unknown Company", all scores = 0)
- `audit_score_breakdown` (missing entry - never created)

---

## 🔍 **Additional Investigation Needed**

### **Question 1: Where did "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" occur?**
- Error is stored in `ai_visibility_audits.error_message`
- Likely in scoring calculation code
- Need to search for `.get()` calls on variables that might be strings

### **Question 2: Why overall_score = 10.00?**
- All component scores are 0.00
- But overall_score shows 10.00
- Possible default value? Manual intervention?
- Check dashboard_data_populator scoring logic

### **Question 3: Why no audit_score_breakdown entry?**
- This table should be populated after analysis
- Missing entry suggests scoring failed
- Check if code that inserts into this table uses `.get()` on strings

---

## 📝 **Summary**

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. ✅ Brand detection fails for parenthetical brand names ("Company Name (Brand)")
2. ✅ Company data retrieval has silent fallback to "Unknown Company"
3. ❓ Mysterious "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error (not yet located)

**Fixes Proposed:**
1. ✅ Smart brand name variation extraction
2. ✅ Explicit error raising instead of silent fallbacks
3. ✅ Brand detection validation with warnings

**Next Steps:**
